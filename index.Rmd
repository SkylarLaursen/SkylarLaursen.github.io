I am a Postdoctoral Fellow jointly at the [University of Waterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca/) and the [University of Ottawa](https://www.uottawa.ca/en), working with Dr. Evan Risko, Dr. Colin MacLeod, and Dr. Erin Maloney. My research focuses on metacognitive processes in learning and memory - examining how individuals monitor and regulate their cognition to enhance understanding and performance. I am deeply passionate about advancing knowledge in this area and translating these insights into practical strategies for education and lifelong learning. Equally committed to teaching and mentoring, I strive to create engaging, evidence-based learning environments that empower students to think critically and develop metacognitive skills.
